# Java/Jakarta EE on Azure Magic Mystery Show

This fast-paced, demo-driven, entirely slide free session will show you the many ways of effectively deploying a Java/Jakarta EE application to Azure. We will start by deploying a local Jakarta EE application to basic IaaS on Azure. We will then deploy the same application to a managed Azure PaaS. Finally we will deploy the application to Azure using Docker and Kubernetes. We will discuss the trade-offs of each approach on the way, offering guidelines for which approach might be best for your application on the cloud. At the end of the session, you will have all the demos on GitHub so you can explore them on your own.
